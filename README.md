### Use [this link](https://the-mute-bow.github.io/) to play.

## New in this version:

-   Now use animation duration instead of frames count so the game speed is no longer relative to fps.
-   Added `Entity.pos.z` in consideration to draw `"main"` and `"shadow"` sprites.
-   Humans now move by a dynamic velocity.
-   `Human.sprites.main` now follows movement's direction.
