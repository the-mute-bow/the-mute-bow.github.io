### Use [this link](https://the-mute-bow.github.io/) to play.

## New in this version:

-   Better camera system and transitions with `game.cam.target` and `game.cam.targ_h`.
-   Using `game.cam.h` to calculate `game.scale`.
-   Black screen with animation through `game.cam`.
-   Humans with four characters: Eliot, Karmen, Lea and Scott.
-   Use of a `Human` instance for `game.cam.target`.
-   `game.player` is now a `Human` instance and moves thanks to the left joystick.
